# My Favorite Zsh Aliases and Functions

This is a collection of the Zsh aliases and functions that I have found 
make my workflow 100x faster and easier.  

I've collected these from perusing the internets, so feel free to take what you want.

If you have any recommendations, shoot me an email!

Cheers :+1:
